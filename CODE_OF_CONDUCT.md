# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the Promethium project, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other community members
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being collaborative and supportive in technical discussions

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable:

- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviors
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders and maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki)
- Project communication channels (mailing lists, chat rooms)
- Project events and meetups
- Any other forums created by the project team for community engagement

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement.

### How to Report

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to the project maintainers via the contact information provided in [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md).
2. **GitHub**: For public incidents, you may also open a moderation issue (if appropriate) or contact maintainers directly.

### What to Include

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
- Description of the behavior and why you consider it unacceptable
- Date, time, and location of the incident
- Any additional context or evidence (screenshots, links, etc.)
- Whether you would like the incident to remain confidential

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals

Individuals who have been subject to enforcement actions may appeal by contacting the project maintainers with a clear explanation of why they believe the decision should be reconsidered. Appeals will be reviewed by maintainers not involved in the original decision.
